# The Oregon Trail

## A remake in Java


*"The Oregon Trail"* video game series was one of the 
first PC video games that got people interested in 
the industry during the 1970's and 80's. The game was originally as an education tool in 
middle schools, but became popular with the general-public due to its creativity and difficulty.


My project will provide a faithful recreation of the original series, with its level of detail
and difficulty mirroring the classic. Hopefully, this can provide enjoyment to those with fond 
memories of the original game, and teach others about gaming history and also the history of pioneers.
I became interested in the Oregon Trail after learning that my ancestors participated in the Mormon Trek,
which coincided with the Oregon Trail.
